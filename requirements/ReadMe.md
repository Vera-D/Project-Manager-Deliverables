# Introduction 
Requirements are central to project continuity. Writting good requirements in an organization requires baselining, training, adoption and iterations.
## Scope
This directory will show examples for level 1, level 2 and level 3 requirements that can be useful for a team getting started with a project. 
- level 1 will describe USER NEEDS
- level 2 will describe System Requirements
- level 3 will describe Sub-system requirements
# Process
Define with the team stakeholders the system from the Users point of view. A helpful resource is to use business process modeling notation. 
- [Sketch miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/index.html) is a nice tool that allows users to start defining the system and processes using simple language. The tool has been used for healthcare projects[^1].
