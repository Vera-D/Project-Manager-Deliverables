# Big room planning
This is a quarterly meeting to align SMEs and the development team. The objective is to organize and commit to the work from the backlog to deliver in the upcoming sprints. This is a practical process to align large groups.

This is a two day meeting that aligns multiple teams towards a singular focused goal. That goal is to make a plan for the next 3 months to achieve XYZ. Prior to the big room planning, user needs, Epics and user stories should have been estimated and prioritized. An appropriate slice of requirements could include the top 10 features in the backlog, but this depends on the team size.
