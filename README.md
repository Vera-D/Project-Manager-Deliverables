# UI_wireframe_examples
This repo has links to wireframes created with AdobeXD or Figma during 2019-2020

During my studies at Tampere University I have been able to work on a few user interface mock ups for a medical device company (Vitec), a RoboCivics project and local startup(Zealbots). I have attached examples of the work produced for the diferent groups, which includes journey maps and wireframes.
