# UI/UX Examples

In this repository I have links to wireframes, storyboards, and journeymaps I created with various tools including: 
- AdobeXD 
- Figma 

The UI/UX material was developed for a software company  [(Vitec)](./Vitec) that provides software for hospitals and clinics, a RoboCivics project [(UXbotz)](./UXbotz) intended to teach children about microplastics, and finally for a startup [(Zealbots)](./ZealBots) that was developing an AI powered search engine.
